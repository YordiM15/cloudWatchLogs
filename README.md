# CloudWatch Logs
The aim is to add python scripts in order to modify log groups within AWS CloudWatch. 

Everyone must know everything about the high fees that CloudWatch could charge us for exporting and store the logs, it's a complete headache when your application and microservices starts to grow in a good way but at the same time, the charges for logging are increasing too. 

In this repo, I am going to add some scripts which could help to organize, modify and also export some logs or log groups to AWS S3 bucket, so we can save money storing the logs into a S3 bucket.
